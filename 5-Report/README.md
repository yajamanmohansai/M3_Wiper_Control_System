# ABSTRACT
The wiper control system control is basically used to wipe the water on the wind shield during rain.The working of these wiper system is basically done with a motor control.Instead of motor we considered led working speed as wiper movement and considered a microcontroller STM32 as working of wiper system basically STM32 is a family of microcontroller ICs based on the 32-bit RISC ARM cortexM4.

# INTRODUCTION
A wiper speed control system regulates the operational speed of a wiper based on frequency. To create a control signal, the pulse signal is digitally processed. The control signal is received by a wiper driving circuit, which modifies the operational speed or timing in response.

# SOFTWARE REQUIRED
STM32 IDE,Quemu,Cygin

# COMPONENTS
MICROCONTROLLER BOARD STM32F7
 
# FEATURES 0F STM32F407VG MICROCONTROLLER
* The STM32F407VGT6 microcontroller contains a 32-bit ARM.
* Cortex-M4 with FPU core, 1-Mbyte Flash memory, and 192-Kbyte RAM in a LQFP100 package.
* STM32F4 DISCOVERY (old reference) or STM32F407G-DISC1 on-board ST-LINK/V2 or ST-LINK/V2-A (new order code).
* Three independent USB ST-LINK connectors and re-enumeration capabilities.
* Debug port for virtual com port (with new order code only).
* Large-scale archiving (with new order code only).
* The board is powered by USB or an external 5 V supply source.
* External application power supplies of 3 V and 5 V.
### USES
* Printing and scanning machines, heat ventilation, air conditioning, and security systems all use this microcontroller.


# WORKING PRINCIPLE
Assume the microcontroller is the automobile. When the button is pressed, the first led (red) turns on, the wiper starts, and the second led (blue) turns on at the desired rate. The third led (green) will turn on if the button is pressed again, and the wiper speed will be increased in contrast to the previous one. The fourth press will activate the fourth led (orange) and raise the wiper speed in accordance with the previous one. After the fifth click, the microcontroller (vehicle) is turned off.

# SWOT- Strengths, and Weakness, Opportunities Threats:
# Strengths
Easy to utilize, Fast and exactness activity.

# Weakness
If sometimes system fail it will stop at middle.

# Opportunities
It is can be implemented with sensors works automatically.

# Threat
Board if damaged cannot be replaced.

# 4W'S
# WHAT IS WIPER SYSTEM
It is a control used to clear water on wind shield of a vehicle.

# WHY IS WIPER SYSTEM
Maintain a clean windscreen that allows for a clear view at all times.

# WHEN SHOULD USE WIPER SYSTEM
The windshield wipers clear the windshield of rain and snow, and the headlights improve visibility at night.

# WHO USE WIPER SYSTEM
The one who drives a vehicle well advanced.

# Conclusion
The implementation of these wiper system control helps driver to help safe journey during rains.According to fast actions of wiper the water along the wiper system gets pushed away from the wind shield.Such that there will be clear view of roads and obstacles to driver to drive carefully and safely.
